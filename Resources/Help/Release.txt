1. Describe the changes in Readme.md

2. PULL EVERYTHING FROM REMOTE BEFORE BUILDING!

3. Perform the following steps in any order:
	- Windows/Release-Package.bat
	  - You need 7z.exe and msbuild.exe in your path, e.g.:
	    `set PATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin";"C:\Program Files\7-Zip";%PATH%`
	- Commit changes
	- Mac/Release-Package.sh
	- Commit changes
	- Build Linux binary
	- Commit changes

	Do not forget to commit the changes, which are a result of the automatic increase of the build no.
	The finished Windows and Mac binaries are in the Release folder now.

4. Update the repository:
	- If the build is a new release (major or minor version no increase), then create a new branch for it. The name of the branch should be Release_<major>.<minor>.0
	  git checkout -b Release_1.0.0
	  - Switch back to the master branch and update the major and / or minor version number in Source/Version
	- If the build is a maintenance release, then create a tag for it in the appropriate branch. The name of the tag should be Release_<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>
	  git tag -a Release_1.0.1
	  - Update the maintenance version number in Source/Version
	  - Commit all changes
	  - Switch to the master branch and merge any bug fixes!


5. Upload the documentation if there were changes.

6. Publish the binaries
	- Upload the zip files to the appropriate sub directories on the website.
	- Make sure the downloads page shows them properly.
	- Announce the release on func, inside3d quakeone.com, twitter, facebook.
